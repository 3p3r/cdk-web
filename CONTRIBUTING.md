# Contributing to cdk-web

Thanks for your contribution in advance!

I personally welcome all sorts of colorful PRs :)

Go crazy! Add crazy shit! include 2GB WASM binaries! I do not care! go for it.

Here is my current procedure for PRs from outside of the circle of the people I closely work with:

- Fork cdk-web
- Make your changes in your own fork
- Make a PR against the `main` branch of cdk-web from your fork
- I will work with you to make sure the commit is all safe and sound
- I will branch out of `main` for you and you'll have to re-target your PR
- I will merge your newly re-targeted PR

If this process seems odd to you, it really is :) this project grew faster than I thought. I'll revise if need arises.
